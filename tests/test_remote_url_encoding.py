"""
An http(s) URL is taken as already percent-encoded (#825).

``resolve_file_url()`` used to percent-encode the path component of every
HTTP(S) URL, with ``%`` absent from its ``safe`` set. A URL the user pasted
from a browser -- ``https://example.com/my%20file.parquet`` -- was therefore
encoded a second time into ``my%2520file.parquet``, and the server answered
404 for a file it holds.

There is no way to tell ``my%20file.parquet`` (an encoded space) from
``my%2520file.parquet`` (a file whose name really contains ``%20``) by looking
at the string, which is the same shape as the SQL-escaping problem #718/#803
solved: transform exactly once, at a boundary where the input's state is known.
Per RFC 3986 a URL *is* the encoded form, so the boundary is the caller: gpio
passes an http(s) URL through verbatim and encodes nothing.

The deliberate cost is the breaking side, pinned below: a URL containing a raw
space or bracket is no longer encoded for the user either.
