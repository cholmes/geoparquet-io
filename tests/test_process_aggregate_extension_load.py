"""The aggregate entry points must load their grid extension via the helper.

Both ran raw ``INSTALL a5 FROM community`` / ``LOAD a5`` and so skipped the
telemetry opt-out that issue #779 added, which is what made
``gpio process aggregate a5`` keep exiting 139 after ``gpio add a5`` was fixed.

These stay in the fast suite deliberately: the real path installs a community
extension over the network, so without a stub the two changed lines are covered
only by the slow lane and the diff-coverage gate fails.
