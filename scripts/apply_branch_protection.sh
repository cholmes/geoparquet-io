# apply_branch_protection.sh
#
# WHAT THIS DOES
#   Migrates geoparquet/geoparquet-io from legacy "classic" branch protection
#   to GitHub repository rulesets, and enables repo-level auto-merge.
#
#   It is a one-shot admin task: run it ONCE after the CI-hardening PR merges.
#
#   Concretely it:
#     1. Enables auto-merge on the repository.
#     2. Deletes the classic branch-protection rule on `main` (if present).
#     3. Creates (or updates) ONE branch ruleset targeting `main`:
#          A. "main: PR + green checks" - forces PR + passing status checks
#             for EVERYONE (no bypass actors, including admins).
#     4. Deletes the retired "main: review required" ruleset if it is still
#        present. See section 3b for why it went away.
#     5. Prints a verification summary.
#
# REQUIREMENTS
#   - `gh` CLI authenticated as a user with ADMIN permission on the repo.
#     (Ruleset + branch-protection + repo-settings writes all require admin.)
#   - `jq` on PATH (used to build/validate the JSON payloads and parse output).
#
# SAFE TO RE-RUN
#   Idempotent. Rulesets are matched by NAME via a GET, then updated with PUT
#   if they already exist, or created with POST if they don't. Re-running
#   converges the live config to what this script declares - it will not create
#   duplicate rulesets. Enabling auto-merge and deleting classic protection are
#   likewise no-ops on a second run.
#
# RELATED MANUAL STEP (NOT done by this script)
#   The security-audit bot opens/updates PRs and needs a token that can bypass
#   the rulesets' identity. Create a fine-grained Personal Access Token scoped
#   to THIS repository only, with:
#       - Contents:      Read and write
#       - Pull requests: Read and write
#   and store it as the repository Actions secret named BOT_PR_TOKEN.
#   (A fine-grained PAT is preferred over a classic PAT so the grant stays
#   limited to geoparquet/geoparquet-io.)
#
#   NOTE: a fine-grained PAT must name the geoparquet ORG as its resource
#   owner, which requires the org to have opted in to fine-grained PAT
#   access (org owners: Settings -> Third-party Access -> Personal access
#   tokens). If the org does not appear in your resource-owner dropdown,
#   fall back to a classic PAT with the `repo` scope - it works with plain
#   repo write access, at the cost of covering every repo your account can
#   reach. Either way, store it with:
#       gh secret set BOT_PR_TOKEN --repo geoparquet/geoparquet-io

# 3b. (removed) Ruleset B: "main: review required"
#
#     A second ruleset used to require 1 approving review, with bypass actors
#     for the admin role. It was deleted on 2026-08-13. This repository has a
#     single active reviewer, and GitHub disables self-approval, so the rule
#     could never be satisfied on that reviewer's own PRs. Every merge became
#     a "merge without waiting for requirements" click, which is a step
#     rather than a second opinion.
#
#     Neither bot nor draft PRs depended on it. Dependabot auto-merge is
#     controlled by .github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml, and GitHub
#     refuses to enable auto-merge on a draft PR at all.
#
#     To reinstate a review requirement, build a second payload here, call
#     apply_ruleset with it, and drop the delete_ruleset call below.

STALE_RULESET_NAME="main: review required"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NET EFFECT
#   Ruleset A carries no bypass actors, so everyone - contributors and admins
#   alike - must open a PR and get all 13 checks green before anything lands
#   on main. Nobody pushes straight to main, force-pushes it, or deletes it.
#
#   No approving review is required. Contributors without write access still
#   cannot merge their own PRs, because merging needs write access.
